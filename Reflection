I used the next typescript features while working on this SBA: type annotations for variables and function parameters, class property types, return types like Promise<Product[]>, the unknown type in error handling, and typed object structures in constructors.
Everything was divided into objects like classes and functions, as needed in object-oriented programming. The challenge was to think about the whole logic of the program and then to implement it. I overcame it by additional reading and googling to understand new concepts more.
That took some time so another challenge was to make everything as fast as possible (still took too much time).
Asynchronous operations are handled with Promises and key words async/await. Errors are handled with try/catch blocks.
